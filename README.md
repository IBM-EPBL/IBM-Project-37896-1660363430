          PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
          
          
          Machine learning has become a tool used in almost every task that requires estimation.
          We need to build a model to estimate the price of used cars. The model should take car
          related parameters and gives output as a selling price. 
          The selling price of a used car depends on certain features as Fuel type, Manufacturing year,Miles driven,Number of owners .
          This is a supervised learning problem and can be solved using regression techniques.
          We need to predict the selling price of a car based on the given car's features.
          Regression problems require labelled data where our target or dependent variable 
          is the selling price of a car.All other features are independent variables. 
          Some regression algorithms are linear regression,Decision tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor etc.,
